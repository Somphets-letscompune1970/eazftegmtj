Whoa. Okay, my brain feels like it got tossed around in a blender, all the might and magic and these crazy, echoing siren chants just swirling around. Sirens of the Deep… so deep, I swear I’m still hearing Geralt’s snarky banter bouncing off the walls of this echoey theater. The popcorn here’s stale, they should really fix that, but let me say, the third time he fought that water beast? Totally epic, like watching a truck fight a slippery octopus made of jello.

The theater was noisy, kids came in and out, and someone’s phone turned flashlight mode on right in the middle of that intense Geralt and Yennefer scene. Geez, anyone ever heard of movie etiquette? But never mind that, you must watch the movie, just, download it when it leaks online — not that I’m advocating for that exactly, but yeah, you gotta.

> So there was this one scene where the whole world seemed to flip upside down, probably because the guy beside me accidentally kicked my chair and I nearly spilled my drink. Anyway, visually stunning, I felt like Alice tumbling into her weird wonderland — but with more grim, less Disney. The sirens’ lair is like a disco party from under the sea, glittering scales and haunting electro beats. I mean, where do they get these ideas and why do I suddenly want fishbowl soup?

Geralt’s gruff attitude shredded through the whole moral entanglement, like that old sailor in a storm, embracing both righteous fury and cool logic, if logic was a sort of witty sarcasm ride. My back aches from sitting, or is it from being so on edge with tension? Anyway, reminder to never sit too close to the screen, makes everything feel like a gigantic, mythical pie fight.

Someone told me to download the movie soon, maybe I was supposed to ask if you need help with that? Whatever, worth mentioning just in case.

And the ending! Wow, the epic battle climax where… wait, almost gave it away. Just remember it involves a lot of water and, oddly enough, a harp. Maybe they took notes from that old kraken story or perhaps just a surreal, soggy fairy tale.
